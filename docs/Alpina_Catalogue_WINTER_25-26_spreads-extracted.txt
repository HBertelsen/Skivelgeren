The right fit enhances your experience by providing the appropriate level of comfort, support, and control
based on your activity style and level. Whether you prefer the relaxed feel of Comfort boots, the balanced
support of Fitness boots, or the precise fit of Performance boots, selecting the right fit ensures you get the
most out of your footwear.
Boot width, or last width, refers to the measurement across the widest part of the forefoot. It determines how
snugly or loosely the boot fits around the foot. Narrow widths provide a tighter, performance-oriented fit, while
wider widths offer more room for comfort.
Boot volume describes the overall space inside the boot, including both the width and height of the instep
and the room around the foot. Low-volume boots fit more snugly for precise control, while high-volume boots
provide more space for comfort, especially for those with larger or higher-arched feet.

Flex refers to how much a boot’s sole bends, impacting performance across activities. A stiffer flex offers more
support, ideal for skating and demanding terrains, while a softer flex allows a natural stride, perfect for classic
skiing. Medium flex provides balance for backcountry and double poling, delivering both flexibility and control.
Choosing the right flex enhances power, comfort, and stability for each specific technique.
FLEX
Graceful and Flexible
A soft flex sole is perfect for classic skiing. It offers a smooth, forgiving stride, making it easy to handle various
terrains. This design provides comfort and precise control for cross-country skiers as they glide through snow
effortlessly.
Adaptable and Versatile
Medium flex soles are perfect for outdoor adventures and double-poling techniques. They offer the right balance
for cross-country skiing, allowing you to tackle diverse terrains with ease while maintaining speed and control
on trails.
Solid and Powerful
A stiff flex sole is essential for skating techniques. It provides the rigidity and responsiveness needed for
efficient, forceful strides, giving skaters the foundation to maximize performance and speed on the snow.

The Alpitex membrane provides additional protection against water and moisture,
which increases comfort, even in more extreme weather conditions.
A braid angle of 45° relative to the longitudinal direction of the shoe improves the
torsional stability of the soft part of the shoe. This ensures a tight fit between the shoe
and the foot in the rotation phase of the shoe toward the inner side when skiing the
skating technique. It also improves the torsional stability of the overall shoe and helps
deliver power to the user.
A braid angle of 90° relative to the longitudinal direction of the shoe provides maximum grip in the instep and
ensures a tight fit between the boot and the heel when skiing the classical technique.
Material: Felt
Advanced use of insulation provides the foot with maximum thermal comfort.
“Thinsulate” insulation provides up to twice as much thermal shoe insulation. It provides
the foot maximum thermal comfort even under icy and high-humidity conditions.
4DRY stands for an innovative system made from bi-elastic PES textile material
laminated with a membrane that allows the boot water impermeable and allows it to
breathe. The material feels light and is hydrophobic, whisking away water and moisture
to maximize comfort and ensure a dry and warm foot.
Material: Polyester and TPU foil
Ultralight thin-layer elastic Polyester-made gaiters combine breathability and water tightness. It improves the
lightness of the shoe. The inside side is equipped with thin PU foil to prevent water and moister penetration
and absorption, while the instep area is free of any foil to ensure breathability. Gaiters are equipped with
elastic tape for gaiter adaptability to various lower leg shapes.
Material: PVC and Neoprene
Made out of PVC, it enables strength, lightweight, elasticity, and high durability, while NEOPRENE maintains
good flexibility over a wide temperature range and offers good insulation against both wet and cold.

also breathable in the instep area of the shoe.
Alpina offers two unique lacing systems for cross-country and backcountry boots: Diamond Lacing and Prime
Lacing. Both systems are designed to improve torsional stability and power transfer, but they have slightly different
characteristics. Alpina Diamond Lacing and Prime Lacing are two unique lacing systems that offer improved torsional
stability and power transfer for cross-country and backcountry boots. The best lacing system for you will depend on
your individual needs and preferences.
Alpina membranes are designed to keep your feet dry, warm, and comfortable in any weather condition. Whether
you're skiing through deep powder or skating on groomed trails, Alpina membranes will help you stay protected from
the elements. They are also lightweight and durable. This makes them a good choice for winter cross- and back-
country boots, as they won't add too much weight to your boots and they will last for many seasons.
